Its weird because thats not what I got from that entire scene.Will missed a year of his life. He explained this not once but twice this season. His friends got to develop, explore their thoughts and grow into themselves.Will was just an empty shell during the last year of his childhood. He just wants to play games with his friends, whom were all just as obsessed about kid crap the year before.During the scene, Will was frustrated because he didnt realize when all this happened. Imagine missing key chunks in your life that were defining moments for your friends."

59453,SadMoma,5tg5yq,3636,2017-02-11,I Avoided Stranger Things because of all the hype. I feel real stupid right now.,259,"Holy fucking shit fuck this is probably the best thing Netflix will ever produce. The acting, outstanding.The Writing, incredible.The music, Orgasmic.I thought everyone was circlejerking and overhyping the show but I sat down to see how the first two episodes were, and not even realizing I was on Episode four I was absolutely in love with the show. Cannot WAIT For Season 2!EDIT 1: To everyone making ""you're stupid for thinking you were to cool for a show."" Just stop, I'm an adult who's running a business, I don't have nearly as much time as I do for netflix anymore. When you have a family, band, and business to run, try sitting down uninterrupted for 50 minute every day to watch a show. EDIT 2: Since people are literally threatening to shit post my business and harassing me for absolutely no reason, allow me to put a SECOND Edit. I run a business in Philadelphia, I miss the days when I could just sit down and just enjoy the fuck out of a movie or TV show. I can't do that anymore. I had a lot of people tell me how great it was, but with the lack of time I have it makes it hard for me to just invest in these kinds of shows. I got home pretty late one night, and decided I would watch the first episode of Stranger Things, a show that I've had memes and references shove in my face on social media. It was such an interesting show, and sooner than I knew it, I'd watched more than one episode and it time for me to start getting ready for work. I'm absolutely in love with the show, like I said the writing, characters, acting, and just the overall tones and beauty of the show are so fresh and unique. If you have some sort of problem with me loving a TV show and still living a busy life than cool, give me all the down votes you want. That's not how Friends should Treat Friends, and it just goes to show who the real mouth breathers are in this sub. "
53392,PetevonPete,7zz3xu,3503,2018-02-24,It's kind of a miracle we don't all hate Mike in Season 2.,239,"Ever since I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFohtfAXbuE), I've been appreciating how the entire fanbase somehow didn't turn against Mike's character in Season 2. In pretty much every scene, he's constantly irritated, controlling, and whining about something to his friends and is a straight up dick to Max for no good reason. He's not really what you would call a likable character by any definition. Sure, the show makes it clear *why* he's behaving this way, but that very often doesn't matter to audiences, especially with kid characters. Audiences usually have very little patience for teenage characters behaving like teenagers.I'm not exactly sure why Mike *didn't* annoy me in Season 2 but the writers really deserve praise for tackling a character arc that could have very, *very* easily backfired and ruined the show for a lot of people."
50229,Implyingi,b4oxl1,3431,2019-03-23,My 77 year old Grandmother's thoughts of Stranger Things Season 1 (Episode 1 and 2),150,"My grandmother was fed up with normal TV so I decided to show her Netflix and we ended up watching 2 episodes of Stranger Things. Here's her thoughts so far.Hopper - ""He's the lazy cop but he has a good heart really I think""Eleven - ""She has something in her head, poor little thing""Joyce Byers - ""Poor, poor lady, (she) is a good actor I really feel sorry for her""Steve - ""That boy is after one thing, he's a bad influence. Smoking AND drinking!""Nancy - ""Silly young girl, her friend (Barb) had more sense!""Mike - ""A GOOD boy"" (Emphasis for comparison to Steve I think?)Dustin - ""A funny smile for a funny boy he reminds me of you""  - Thanks! Jonathan Byers - ""Needs a haircut but I feel bad for him because his dad is a no-good'n""And my personal favourite:Bobby (The diner owner who finds Eleven) - ""Poor man, why did those nasty men kill him? I hope he kills them back!""(He's dead, how can he ""Kill them back""?)""Oh I don't know; there's a monster isn't there?""That's all she had to say about characters. And her overall thoughts on the show was:""It's a good show, it's not too violent and not too scary; I like it!"" We plan to watch more and if people liked this perhaps I'll post her future thoughts on the show. I'll even be happy to ask appropriate comment questions.Bonus:(Episode 2) As Joyce Byers moves towards the stereo in Will's room the lights flicker and a figure presses against the wall from the inside. *Gasps* ""ITS A WALL MAN!""Thanks for reading.

This series, however, felt like it was actually amplified by it. The chapter cuts made sense but including chapters that started from the end of the last chapter kept an up-tempo pace I haven't seen in a series before. Very excited for a new distribution method that allows media to focus on long-form. "

But a huge marvel fan.In the first episode when Will and Dustin are racing, Will specifically asks for his 'X-Men: #134'.'X-Men: #134' revolves around Jean Grey who essentially has near enough the same powers as Eleven (but is a lot more powerful).At one point in this issue of X-Men, Jean Grey uses her powers to pin Mastermind against the wall.This 'scene' in the comic is nearly identical to the ending of Stranger Things 1 when Eleven pins the Demogorgon against the chalk board in the classroom!Some people may already know about this small detail but I thought it was really awesome of the Duffer Brothers to add that 'Easter Egg' into the mix.] (/spoiler)"

43140,xbuck33,ceeocv,2583,2019-07-17,This is why Steve is the best character,121,"When we see Dustin show up at Scoops Ahoy for the first time, Steve is ecstatic to see him and they do their handshake. Starts pretty normal and ends with a nice short light saber battler where Dustin kills Steve. Great handshake. Star wars themed seems very par for the course for two teens in the 80's.**BUT**At the end of the season we see Steve applying for a job at the movie store, and he is asked his favorite movies. He freezes for a second spits out Animal house to Robin's annoyance and then says Star Wars but in a really unsure way. When asked if he means ""A New Hope"", he says ""a new what?"" When asked which Star Wars, he says the one with the Teddy Bears. So what do we get from this? **Steve couldn't give two shits about Star Wars**. Doesn't care at all. Despite not caring about the movies though, **he's willing to do a super animated handshake in public of a light saber battle with Dustin because Dustin loves it**. Like season 1 Steve wouldn't be caught dead with one of the kids and now we have him publicly doing super nerdy things with a 13 year old. He let Dustin make up this handshake and is completely down doing it anywhere and goes all in on it instead of half trying like the cool kids.Steve is just the best lol"

65167,heyiknowstuff,4tfv8r,2222,2016-07-18,Steve did nothing wrong.,294,"Steve is a giant douche is the consensus about Steves character on this sub. Generally, you can find some version of that statement littered through fan comments. Its time to address this mischaracterization before it gets out of hand. Lets look at some of the common complaints about Steve:&gt;When Steve helped Nancy study he had other intentions.Hes a teenager, of course he wants to bone. When Nancy stopped his advances, he respectfully stepped back and actually did help her study. &gt;Steve having a party and chugging beers is a classic douche move. Again, hes a teenager. We all had parties and shot gunned beers to impress people. During this party he A. made sure to invite Barb and include her in the fun, B. let Nancy make the first move.&gt;Steve broke Jonathans camera.Yeah, thats a pretty good move instead of beating the shit out of Jonathan. The creep took pictures of Nancy taking off her clothes. If someone took a picture of my SO disrobing through a window, from way back in a dark forest, I wouldve freaked the fuck out. At that point in the story, Jonathan deserved to have charges pressed against him. Really though, Steve shouldnt have broken the camera, and just called the police. That said, every single one of you can understand and empathize with the motivation. For Jonathan, having your camera broken is probably a better punishment than being labeled a sexual predator.Oh and Steve bought Jonathan a new camera. Steve let Nancy give it, not taking any of the credit himself. &gt;Steve was a dick about good ol Barb. We dont know what his family life is like  I would also be pretty worried about my parents reaction if they found out I had a party where a friend went missing. May have been a bit selfish and short sighted, but again, hes a teenager. Given enough time, he was able to realize his mistake and went to apologize. Not only did he go to apologize, but he tried to get Nancys mind off the whole thing and was legitimately worried about her. He even expressed these feelings to his dickbag friends  he let his guard down in front of those tools. Steve is emotionally vulnerable, but he is willing to do so for Nancy.Steve also defended Babs to his dickbag friends. He never once made fun of her. &gt;Steve shouldnt have spray painted the sign.He didnt. He told his friend not to do it. Even after bloodied and beaten to a pulp by Jonathan, he confronted his dickbag friends and basically told them to fuck off. Steve also went to the movie theater to clean off the paint that he had nothing to do with. He felt guilty and didnt want Nancys name tarnished throughout the town. Steve was hurt, caught Nancy in what could only be seen as an emotional/tender moment between N&amp;J, and Nancy was unable to offer an explanation. Still, he didnt want the spray paint, and didnt hold it against either Nancy or Jonathan that he got his ass beat. Steve even went to Jonathans house, not expecting Nancy to be there, to apologize for his behavior (as justified as it may have been)  man to man. With a gun pointed to his head and monster chasing after him, Steve had every right to run the fuck away. It had nothing to do with him. With keys in hand, ready to start his car and drive to safety, Steve ran back in and saved Jonathan (the guy he still thinks took his girlfriend) from the Demogorgon. Are we out of our minds here? Every one of Steves actions either had a justified motivation or were straight up heroic. There were hints of self-preservation and teenage-immaturity from time to time, but judging the character off of basic human traits is just silly. "
53236,NeoGothica,8a2kk5,2062,2018-04-05,[Spoilers] The one underlying issue I have with the show.,125,"Foreword: love the show overall, and am eagerly anticipating season 3 as much as the next person. But no matter how hard I try, I just can't give a damn about Will Byers.In season 1, Will becomes the McGuffin right off the bat. We're shown how his absence affects the people close to him, so we're able to understand their pain as we get to know the characters and watch them grow. However, we don't get that with Will. Sure, we're shown that he's going through Hell, and we get to know him a little bit, but that's trying to invoke sympathy retroactively (i.e. putting events before character as opposed to character before events).In season 2, Will's back, but he's at a disadvantage. This is our first time seeing him interact with the rest of the world since the beginning of the show, so he might as well be a new character. However, he's quickly reverted back to being the McGuffin when it's shown that he's still going through Hell on Earth, so we again look at everyone else BUT him.Now, I care about what *happens* to Will, because it affects the other characters. As far as Will himself is concerned? I honestly couldn't care less if he drops dead out of nowhere.Will has no character arc. He's such a shameless plot device character that *should* get sympathy, but he doesn't *earn* any because we aren't allowed to have a relationship with him. I *want* to feel for him, but I can't, because I don't *know* him. "

44430,Juiceistasty11,cc6e4o,1921,2019-07-12,Billy's surprisingly significant decision,90,"So, I've been seeing a lot of posts about Billy's sacrifice at the end where he defies the Mindflayer, but the very first time he resisted, at the pool with Karen, was arguably even more significant for the plot. When Karen finds Billy in the pool storage closet, he has an urge from the Mindflayer to attack and presumably flay Karen, but he resists and tells Karen to stay away from him. This small moment was actually key to ensuring the Mindflayer's defeat.Imagine if Billy had gone along with the Mindflayer's plan and successfully kidnapped/flayed Karen. The logical next step would be to flay the rest of the Wheelers, and most importantly, Mike. Then, it would be pretty simple for the Mindflayer to use Mike to trick Eleven and kill/flay her. Even without having Mike under his control, the Mindflayer was nearly able to get Eleven, so with Mike on his side, I don't think Eleven and the crew would've stood a chance. This moment was extremely pivotal for the Mindflayer, and Billy's resistance was absolutely essential for Eleven to ultimately win.TL;DR - in one seemingly insignificant moment, Billy inadvertantly saved Eleven's life and probably the entire town of Hawkins."

43829,violetsuzette,cd3q5e,1661,2019-07-14,The Twitter crowd wants to destroy all nuance and momentum from Hop's character and turn him into a Gary Stu,176,"People have been complaining CONSTANTLY about how Hop treated El, Joyce  and Mike this season, and saying they ruined his character. Yes, Hopper is a toxic asshole this season. But its important that he is that way. Its what makes hopper a tragic character. Hopper is a Vietnam war vet with PTSD and a guy who lost his daughter and whose wife left him. And that is all season 1. Hopper has suffered a lot, and seen a lot of shit go wrong, and it has left him bitter and anxious. The thing with Hopper is that he wants the family life, but he has never been a good partner or a good father. He wants these things but he's never been good at them. He's a crappy partner and a controlling dad. But it's what he yearns to have. Hopper is great in a crisis, and useless when the world is normal and happy. That's the tragedy of his character.The reason he is so fucked up is because of his trauma and what he lost, it makes him go crazy to preserve what he has gained. Rather than calling Hop a misogynistic blah blah blah think about how he got this way. People were mad Joyce ""rewarded"" Hopper with a date after his behaviour but it wasn't about rewarding him. It was about them coming to understand each other better. It was about Joyce seeing that there was still something good inside him, seeing that he is a good man underneath the trauma. Hopper is, in a lot of ways, like Billy. An asshole as a product of environment. And it doesn't excuse either of them, but it does help to show that an empathetic person can still reach them and help them heal. So yes, Hop is a psycho and a controlling dick and a jealous manchild at times. But that's part of what makes him a great, conflicted character. If Hop was perfect, he would be boring."

45947,AngryKnifeHandsMan,cap5qh,1577,2019-07-08,[spoilers] Thoughts on Robin and Steve,305,"As a lesbian, I was really happy and surprised that they had a coming out scene in a TV show set in the 80's. However, I've seen a lot of complaints that Robin was leading Steve on with their friendship and the conversation they had where she said she was ""obsessed"" with his popularity when they were both in high school. There are people saying that she should have told him she was gay beforehand.Let me tell ya something, coming out is hard. Even when it's to someone that you 100% know and trust, there's always the little voice in the back of your mind that insists that the person will hate you and never want to hang out with you again. And I came out in 2017! Coming out to a person you don't really know all that well in 1985? Forget it.I think people forget how bad things were for LGBT people not that long ago. Being gay in the 80's was way fucking harder than today. People lost their jobs, were ostracized from their communities, were raped and murdered just for being gay. (And yes, it still happens today!)When I was in high school, I was obsessed with this boy on the baseball team because he got all the girls. In my head I was like ""son of a bitch, I have to figure out how to be like him so that girls will like me."" When Robin said that she was obsessed with Steve, that's the first thing I thought of. She was never romantically interested, she just wanted to figure out how he *did* itWhen Steve confesses his feelings for Robin, I felt so bad for her! I've been in the same exact situation, and her slowly sinking her head into her knees was a big fucking mood, lol. I actually started crying when Steve was so accepting because it almost NEVER happens that way. I had a (former) friend get mad at me and say that I had lead him on, and that I *OWE* it to him to be his girlfriend because of it.I just wish those people complaining realize that Robin never owed Steve a relationship in the first place, and that their friendship is more than good enough. (I'm personally excited to have them be each other's Wingman, because that will be some comedy gold)"

45188,aps131997,cbf3yr,1524,2019-07-10,Characters with most spoken lines in Season 1,65,"Hello everyone! I have undertaken a project of logging how many lines each character has per season and episode. A line constitutes of uninterrupted dialogue until someone else talks or the scene or conversation changes, or simply the number of times each person talks. The numbers I have may not be 100% accurate, but I did my best, and I thought it would be fun data to analyze. Here are the results for Season 1 of Stranger Things. 1. Mike Wheeler - 4332. Nancy Wheeler - 3463. Dustin Henderson - 3084. Joyce Byers - 2865. Jim Hopper - 2776. Jonathan Byers - 2697. Lucas Sinclair - 2338. Steve Harrington - 1379. Karen Wheeler - 11110. Eleven/Jane Ives - 10111. Will Byers - 6412. Phil Callahan - 5613. Scott Clarke - 5314. Tommy H. - 4515. Calvin Powell - 4416. Lonnie Byers - 4317. Martin Brenner - 4118. Carol - 3719. Barbara Holland - 3220. Troy - 311st place in each episode in order (number of lines): Joyce (54), Mike (70), Nancy (40), Mike (46), Mike (58), Mike (49), Dustin (66), Mike (69)2nd place in each episode in order (number of lines): Mike (49), Nancy (57), Mike (39), Hopper (40), Dustin (50), Nancy (45), Mike (53), Jonathan (56)3rd place in each episode in order (number of lines): Hopper (46), Joyce (39), Joyce (37), Nancy (37), Nancy (49), Dustin (43), Hopper (36), Dustin (49)TRIVIA- Mike is the only character to make it to the top 3 every episode of Season 1. He also never scores below second place in any episode of Season 1. - Most prominent season for Mike, Nancy, Joyce, Jonathan, Lucas, and Karen for total number of lines. The number of lines Mike has in Season 1 is the highest of any character from all three seasons. This in part due to less major characters juggling dialogue. - More dialogue doesnt necessitate the most screentime. For example, Eleven has a lot of solo scenes where she doesnt say anything in Season 1, but these are all integral to understanding and developing her character. - Most prominent characters that do not make it to the top 3 for any episode in Season 1: Lucas, Steve, Karen, Eleven and Will- Most lines in an episode: Mike with 70 in ""The Weirdo on Maple Street"" followed by Mile with 69 in The Upside Down and Dustin with 66 in The Bathtub - A lot of supporting characters from season 1 that make it to the top 20 either do not appear past this season  (Barb, Lonnie, Troy) or fade into obscurity (Tommy, Carol)"

I remember wondering why Hopper looked so cranky watching TV and at first I thought it was simply because Mike was spending too much time with El and Hopper was in a ""protective dad"" mode. While this is obviously true, I realized he was actually watching (I think) Miami Vice. &amp;#x200B;And if you remember, he tells Joyce in the last episode that he can't do 8PM dinner because he wanted to be home in time for Miami Vice because El liked watching it every Friday. &amp;#x200B;So I'm now feeling sad for Hopper in this moment because he's realizing how fast El is growing, and he just wants to spend time with her, and he probably always blocked out that time to watch the show with her but she was starting to spend that time with someone else.

Each of those three follows one of the common 80s genres.  The kids are in a Spielbergian adventure story - treading the town on bicycles, dealing with the bullies at school and harboring a fugitive with superpowers.  The teenagers are in a teen horror flick - high school drama, sex, a monster that's kidnapping people.  The adults are in a conspiracy thriller. They get to deal with the nefarious g-men and secret LSD experiments."

It was such a treat to watch a show without getting stuck on some serious butchering/lack of an honest attempt at my first language. Not only that, but just about every Russian character actually spoke proper russian. There is a sizeable population of Russian speakers in the states after all. I can only hope that the days of complete gibberish being passed off as a foreign language are coming to an end. Never expected such a thing to make me so excited. This season was SO good.RIP Alexei"

What does he do? He casts Fireball.In the last episode, Jonathan traps the Demogorgon in his house. What does he do? He casts Fireball (throws the lighter on the kerosene). Not sure if this is intentional, but I found it funny that both of the Byers boys fight the Demogorgon the same way.

Jonathan comes from a very poor household with a single mother and it is implied in the show that he helps support the family financially. This job is important to his family's well being. Nancy doesn't really think about the ramifications for Jonathan if he loses his job because her family is well off and she's just looking at this job as a step towards a future career.Nancy is being treated horribly by her sexist boss and coworkers. They are degrading to her and make extremely sexist comments around her. Jonathan doesn't realize how bad this is because he's blinded by his priveledge as a male and he's not seeing this first hand.I love how nuanced this is, showing how each is blinded by priveledge (class or gender), but neither one is wrong for being angry. I find this is true to how life often is, where everything isn't always black and white, and I love that they managed to show that so well here."

52059,theking4mayor,9dmmgn,1035,2018-09-06,[FAN THEORY] Eleven did not escape Hawkins Lab the way you think she did (and its important),109,"\[Season 1 #spoilers ahead\]&amp;#x200B;When searching for Will at the beginning of Season 1, we see the search party find torn fabric from Elevens (Eles) hospital gown on the drain pipe near the lab and distortion on the video footage of the security camera leading us to believe that the government edited/faked the security tape and Ele escaped the facility through the pipe. THIS IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.*Let me explain why and why it is important.*I discovered this a few months ago I was making a [fan edit](https://youtu.be/POw5Jsp8aEk) in which I compiled all of the facility footage of Elevens flashbacks into a single video. At the time of the incident in which Ele escaped, Ele was locked securely in the hibernation tank which was mechanically locked from the outside.Now, I cant say with 100% certainty that she didnt use her telekinetic powers to open the tank and escape on foot, but considering the scene, this is very unlikely. Here is why:&amp;#x200B;1. Given the chaos of the rupture and the release of the Demogorgon, security would have definitely made securing The Asset a number one priority if she had been running around. The reason we dont see this is that since Ele is presumed to be still in the tank (which is locked with the window covered), security presumed that Ele was still safely inside the tank and staying there was the best place for her, making other tasks a priority, such as securing higher ranking government officials who were present on the lower catwalk. They most likely didnt even realize she was missing until after the Demogorgon had left the room when they when to rescue her from the tank.2. The nature of the rift shows us what happened. In all other instances of crossing the vail into the upside-down, travel occurs by opening a portal in a wall, tree, or some other vertical object, leaving very little notice in the physical world unless you are taking notice and it heals itself almost immediately.&amp;#x200B;However, when the rift is opened, it splits from the middle of the rift out across the surfaces of the room. This is because unlike a normal opening of the vail, Ele this time instead teleported. Being suspended in mid-air (or water) in the center of the room and being panicked by the Demogorgon, she acted unintentionally with her only thought of going to a safe space, using a power she not only didnt know she had but also had no way to control.*You might now think this is where she escaped the facility*, *but no*. Because if she did, she wouldnt be wearing the hospital gown, but the submersion suit. The only safe place she knows is her room (the larger cell). On the bottom shelves of her room we see what looks like some towels and are probably extra clothes as well, or new clothes laid out on the bed for when she comes back from the tank.She most likely teleported back to her room, dried and changed herself. Then realizing she could teleport, tried to do it again and failed from exhaustion. She was however, likely to open up a normal portal in the vail and traveled through that, escaping to Mirkwood Forest.&amp;#x200B;Now, I imagine it is mostly believed that the Demogorgon traveled through the rift into the lab, but I think this is also incorrect. In the footage of ""the incident"", we can hear the Demogorgon in the room and see people scrambling about before the rift opens up and the cracks form in the wall. I think that Ele accidentally teleported the Demogorgon into the lab when she teleported out.The Demogorgon confused at suddenly being in an alien world went nuts, attacking everything in sight. The Demogorgon being intelligent and finally realizing what was going on, began to hunt Eleven, knowing that she was a threat. Eventually he tracked down the trail of Eleven, discovering the tears in the vail Ele created, and using those to track her and escape the facility.**Here is why it is important!**Ele, now in Mirkwood and being chased by the Demogorgon, rips her gown and creates several other portals in trees and eventually in Wills house. **The Demogorgon cannot create its own portals in the vail**, it can only use the ones created by Eleven.Will, traveling home from DnD, thinks the Demogorgon is chasing him, but its not! Its chasing Eleven! But will doesnt know this. When he thinks that he running away from the Demogorgon, he is actually moving in parallel to the Demogorgon/Ele chase through Mirkwood, as they pop in and out from the upside-down.Eventually Will catches up to the chase, getting in between Ele and the Demogorgon in the shed. The Demogorgon, being newly familiar with humans, sees Will, thinking Small One, and grabs Will mistaking him for Eleven, (or Will ran through a tear in the vail himself trying to escape the Demogorgon). Thinking it succeeded in it's chase, the Demogorgon returns to the upside-down and gives up his pursuit of Ele.&amp;#x200B;So, when Ele later tells Mike that it is her fault that Will was in the upside down, she doesnt mean that it is because she opened up the rip between worlds, but more literally because she led the Demogorgon to Will and allowed him to be captured, facilitating her own escape. This is why she is so extremely racked with guilt.As she continues her independent adventures outside the facility with the gang, she increases her human empathy as well as the strength of her powers. It is with this emotional connection that she is finally able to successfully use her teleportation powers again (on purpose this time) to teleport the Demogorgon back to the upside-down. She doesnt kill the Demogorgon, but asserts her dominance over it, which is why that particular instance of the Demogorgon no longer tried to cross over into the normal world again.This also makes Hawkins Middle School a secondary hotspot of cross-world activity, thus attracting the Shadow Monster/Mind Flayer, which seems to have a psychic connection with the Demogorgons, or Demogorgi if you prefer.&amp;#x200B;*So what do you think? Do I got something here? Has this come up before? Let me know in the comments! Thanks!*"

Even though I love it, Mike is more than that.First of all, he is a really good friend to Will. No doubt, everyone knows it, I think I don't have to explain this.Second, he figured out so many things. Looks like a lot of people don't notice it, but I would argue that he probably the person who understands the monster best, besides Will maybe.Like, he mentioned that Will could be the spy, and he figured out that Will is actually a double spy. He knew that Will has to be put to sleep so that the monster can't spy them. He figured out that if they stop the boss, they also could stop his armies. He noticed that Will know how to stop the monster and suggested that they have to talk to him in an unknown place. He also warned the others that Will will die if they defeat the monster.And, remember when they just sit around in the Byers house after they come back from the Lab? He lifted the mood and initiated the discussion and action by bringing back the fact that Bob was the founder of Hawkins High AV and he doesn't want them to waste his sacrifice.So, even though he probably got the least character development, he is still a brilliant character, beyond his relationship with El."

Nowadays in movies and every character has to be flawless cause otherwise you are perpetuating toxic behavior in our society or such bs.   The show intentionally doesn't do that, cause that wasn't a thing in the 80's. Our characters are all antiheroes to a degree. What matters is the intetion behind what they do. Hopper is overprotective cause he lost his daughter once. He is impulsive cause that's funny. The teens are young people with no experience in terms of love, it's all part of their growing process.

57481,ScalabrineIsGod,79f0qx,847,2017-10-29,[Spoilers] Dustin was playing the long game this entire time.,23,"I'm a bit drunk right now so sorry if this has already been established and if I don't make sense. My memory of the first season is spotty because I didn't re watch it. Making time is a bitch. In the first season, Dustin is obviously the one with the biggest crush for Nancy among his group. It predictably doesn't go anywhere, due to age difference and lots of stuff, including her dating Steve ""Flow God"" Harrington. Despite that, he gets a good look at Nancy's true personality during all the chaos, and it only helps him in his great game.In the second season, when Max is introduced, we are led to believe that he likes her. This is just a trick to distract us. Lucas was always the only one who had a chance with Max. Dustin ""the Lion"" Henderson had his mind set on a bigger prize. Steve and Nancy were falling apart, and while Jonathan made his moves, successfully, I might add, it was for naught. Nobody stands in the way of the Lion.Dustin knew what he was doing when he and Steve formed their seemingly unlikely duo. Despite all the chaos and shit around him, he was able to get key information out of Steve. He used his ""failed advances"" on Max as a guise for what he planned to later do with Nancy. His clever acting and deception allowed for him to learn what made Steve the Flow God. After all the shit cools down, he ascends into his final form, Flow God 2.0, as he prepares for the dance, and like the mighty hunter he is, goes in for the kill. When Dustin ""Hair so fine it look Divine"" Henderson tells Mike that he is ""going in"" he is telling the truth, but hides the key element. His ""rejection"" at the hands of the other girls is yet another distraction. He foresaw this happening, and knew that Nancy would take pity on the lonely Dustin. His calculations were on point. The moment that she asked him to dance, he completed the circle. Though Steve did it unknowingly, he gave Dustin ""Steal yo bitch"" Henderson the keys. During their dance, when Nancy tells him that he was always her favorite of her brothers group of friends, it serves little point. Flow God 2.0 already knew that long ago. So in short, Dustin played chess while everyone else played checkers. Despite going through all this horrific and traumatizing shit, Dustin displays a cunning drive for success, patience, multitasking, and trickery in getting Nancy. When this series began, he was but the learner. Now from here on, he is the master."

I'm not sure if I'd call Dustin &amp; Dart the greatest example of an animal-friendly storyline - Dustin did cause his other pets to be eaten and he seemed more interested in Dart from a scientific perspective than as an animal-lover. But hey, it's nice for Gaten/Dustin to get singled out for an accolade. I'd also add that Gaten admitted at Comic Con that he'd failed to stay vegetarian. It's a shame they couldn't have given credit to Sadie who is a committed vegan and seems really invested in animal rights activism.   "

40288,DoctorNotorious,cygvu0,799,2019-09-01,I was watching through season 3 again when everything dealing with Billy sunk in...,24,"He could have whatever girl he wanted yet he still kept his gaze set on Karen Wheeler. I think the reason being his deep seated mommy issues. Karen resembled his mother in many ways. She was gorgeous, slim, blonde, and had a son about the same age as him when his mom walked out. Yeah yeah, Oedipus complex, but the part that really hit me was that this is why he was able to resist the Mind Flayer wanting to bash her head in. The only other time we see Billy truly resist the MF was right before his sacrifice. I think the fact that Karen reminded him of his own mother so much and that she chose her family over walking out on them in a sense like Billy's had, is what made Billy control himself enough to tell her to stay away from him. I just think if that's what they meant to portray, they got it across just right in my opinion."

Most of it coming from Shawn Levy (Executive Producer). I thought it would be useful to have all the information in a single location. The sources of the quotes will be available below, I will probably make another post when a lot of new information comes available. If I forget anything, please let me know (with source) so I can update it.## QuotesAll the quotes I could find. I only listed the once from Levy, as he as of right now is the only one who read the script, any quotes from the acters are from what I can tell speculation on their part.&gt;""We're going to give Will a break,"" he says. ""Were not going to put Will through hell for a third season in a row. Hell be dealing with stuff, but he wont be at rock bottom the way we forced the amazing Noah Schnapp to play. ^[1]-&gt;After battling the Shadow Monster one would assume Dustin or Hopper might be next in line to suffer the consequences. ""You might assume that,"" Levy teases, ""but you would probably end up being wrong. We're [going to be] dealing with forces of evil that are new."" ^[1]-&gt;Levy says you'll definitely ""get some Steve/Dustin action."" ^[1]-&gt;Could rebel Billy be the instigator for a more sexually liberated Mrs. Wheeler next season? ""There was clearly a connection there,"" Levy says. ""Karen has some unhappiness that is brewing. I think that makes her vulnerable to all kinds of things in season three. ^[1]-&gt;Levy says they're ""not commenting"" on Reiser's possible return, mainly because ""I don't have a clear-cut answer for you yet."" In other words, stay tuned. ^[1]-&gt;Hawke will play an alternative girl bored with her mundane day job. She seeks excitement in her life and gets more than she bargained for when she uncovers a dark secret in Hawkins, Ind. ^[2]-&gt;Ferguson appeared last season in a guest role as Erica, Lucas strong-willed, little sister. The scene-stealer returns in the next installment with an army of her own friends. No longer content with sitting on the sidelines, Erica finds herself on a wild mission to save Hawkins from a dangerous new threat. ^[2]-&gt;Its very much the Stranger Things I think people know and love. Its big and spooky. Season 3 has legitimately creepy moments and events, but its incredibly warm and character-based because at the end of the day, I think thats what people love most about Stranger Things. ^[3]-&gt;The way [Stranger Things creators the Duffer brothers] build these episodes, it is very much a suspense-driven show. So if you dont want to click through to the next episode, we havent done our job. ^[3]-&gt;""Mike and Eleven and are going strong, so that's a relationship that continues, and same with Mad Max and Lucas. But again, they're like 13- or 14-year-old kids, so what does romance mean at that stage of life? It can never be simple and stable relationships and there's fun to that instability,"" ^[4]-&gt;""We'll definitely get to see some more of Steve Harrington in season three, and I'll just say we won't be abandoning the Dad Steve magic. I don't want to say much more, but I literally feel that we were walking along and we stumbled onto a gold mine with Dad Steve."" ^[4]-&gt;The 1985 film Back to the Future will be a reference in the new season. ^[4]-&gt;Season 3 is set in the summer, so right out of the gate thats a big difference, ^[5]-&gt;The first two seasons were very much school-based. This is that time of year where its not about school, its about the swimming pool and campfires and parades and Fourth of July and fireworks, so theres kind of a poppy fun to Season 3 thats really enjoyable before things inevitably turn super dark. ^[5]-&gt;The shadow monster is still lurking up there out there in the Upside Down. He is determined to find a way to achieve his goals, ^[5]-&gt;He also teased that more casting announcements will be announced, both from established actors and newcomers. ^[5]-&gt;Levy calls Hawke  whose character is described as an alternative girl named Robin  a really exciting, young brand-new face and actor. She came in and auditioned with Joe Keery and had such interesting chemistry and dynamic. Shes just a really spontaneous, in-the-moment actress. ^[5]-&gt;We thought, how fun would it be if we integrate her into some of the plot, Levy said, but shes still super annoying, feisty Erica. Theres a really fun combination of urgency and nuisance that were leaning into with that character. I wont say what happens plot-wise but theres a lot of Erica in season 3. ^[6]-&gt;The Shadow Monster is still out there,"" Levy warned, adding that the danger to come is ""definitely evil related to his agenda, which we learn more about in Season 3."" ^[7]-&gt;We realized early on were not going to stop time, he said. So were not going to pretend that these kids are still 12. Were going to create and dramatize stories that meet kids where they are and that are honest about where theyre at. Season 2 was about the desire to return to normal. Season 3 is about change, the inevitably of change  change is coming for Hawkins, and change is coming for these characters, whether they like it or not. ^[8]-&gt;Im not going to say too much, he said. Theres definitely new love  whether or not its in a love triangle, I dont want to say. ^[8]## Sources[1] https://www.glamour.com/story/stranger-things-season-3-new-details  [2] http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/stranger-things-season-3-new-character-maya-thurman-hawke-1202715637/  [3] http://ew.com/tv/2018/03/26/stranger-things-executive-producer-season-3-is-legitimately-creepy/  [4] https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/stranger-things-first-season-3-details-revealed-1097178  [5] http://variety.com/2018/scene/news/stranger-things-executive-producer-reveals-setting-details-season-three-1202736095/  [6] https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a19599629/stranger-things-season-3-panel-natalia-dyer/  [7] http://www.mtv.com/news/3071005/stranger-things-3-what-we-know/  [8] http://people.com/tv/stranger-things-kids-fight-siblings/"

Sure he's an ass to Max initially, but that's understandable given his age and trauma over the loss of El. But let's remember:- He jumped off a cliff to save his friend.- The only one who gave a shit about saving Will it seems.- The only one who realizes the danger of Dart, and most likely, due to his trauma, took the situation very seriously.- The one who came up with the strategy to spy on the Mind Flayer, and also the first to realize it was spying back- The only one who realizes closing the gate might kill Will before exorcising him first.- Still the little bossy leader of the group when they facing serious shit down in the tunnels until King Steve took overSo let's give mah man some props."

I like how Hopper respects Mike enough to suggest a man-to-man talk in the other room, even though it's obvious the rest of them will be able to hear every word they're saying from the living room. Mike lets out a year's worth of frustrations, and Hopper just lets him wail on himpartially because he knows some of it is justified, but mostly because he has to be the adult. And that transition from trying to restrain him to a hug was an almost father/son moment, something Mike really couldn't get from his real parents, as they had no idea what he'd been going through. It was a nice way to cap off Mike's plotline this season of not being able to deal with El's death.The acting was great from both sides.

50512,mopsarethebomb,awz8of,721,2019-03-03,Possible [Spoilers] I re-watched the Starcourt Mall teaser again and noticed some glaringly obvious bits of information.,85,"&gt;! So during the mall commercial they show us Walden Books, with ""The Hunt for Red October"" in the window, which isn't a continuity error really, but it did actually come out the previous year in 1984. I very much doubt that any book store would be promoting any book a year after it's initial release, *e-fucking-specially* when (and this is if the mall is opening in July which I assume it is because there are American flags every where) Stephen King would have just put out Skelton Crew, that shit would have 100% been the window book. So, what do the Duffer Brothers want us to glean from THfRO? Well it's been about 15 years since I've read it, but I do know it's about an angry Russian defector coming to America in what is a state of the art submarine, because he feels like it's technology was too great and would cause havoc (among other more personal reasons why he defected).Now, the mall... Is an All American (this just slapped me in the face) subsidiary of Starcourt Industries an (no shit) international Enterprise. I wonder which fucking nation it's from, hmmmmmmmmmmm?So is the mall a way to have Russians spies come to work in America because they'd heard about the technology Hawkins Lab was cooking up? Is the bloody mall itself somehow a camouflauged silent weapon? Hmm? Idfk, but I know something fuckey is up with this mall.But wait, there's more! Thanks to the interruption of Dick Clark's rockin ball drop, we got weird clues like ""When blue and yellow meet in the West"" well, well, fucking, well. During the Starcourt commerical, they for some.... Honestly un-fucking-known reason show us a shot of the clock, which has clearly blue and yellow hands. That's.... Yeah... The silver cat feeds. Yeah, when the clock strikes 12 in that bitch, something is going to go buck ass wild. So that just leads me to believe that The Battle of Starcourt, isn't just going to be a battle that happens to take place there, but Starcourt may be the opposing force. Then I have to think about THfRO again, if Starcourt is the weapon, then does that mean someone is working there that is a spy who is trying to defect? Possibly the chick Steve is working with at the ice cream shop?The commercial just seemed so obvious this time when I watched it, with the whole over the top patriotism, and American flags everywhere, how it seemed to want to shove in our faces how wholesome and American it is.Sorry if any or all of this has been mentioned before, I did a search on the sub before I wrote this insane rant out, and didn't see anything specifically pointing out most of this, hopefully some of you guys want to discuss the theories? !&lt;"

Shes getting a lot of hate for being a bad influence on El but I think her history w Billy plays a factor. Also in the relationship dynamics of the show, it feels like the writers like to exemplify a typical view of a character in their demographic. So with Max, shes acting and saying stuff that is very typical 13 year old girl. I definitely knew girls at that age who said the exact stuff she did when I was growing up. Its for viewers to relate to these characters and be like oh yeah I used to think like that/know someone exactly like that! Its like the stuff Mike and Lucas say about girls also sounds so typical 13 year old boy. Steve and Nancys relationship in S1 is a stereotypical high school relationship.

47849,GlamrockShake,c9hufy,654,2019-07-05,[MAJOR SPOILER] ST4 and Another Castle,119,"Just finished ST3 and what an incredible ride. So many more laughs and tears than any other season so far. But...you didnt come here to hear my take on the season. Fully aware that pen has probably not touched paper beyond basic details, I want to offer a prediction for the next season.***Its no secret that Stranger Things has used pop culture references to set the direction of the plot for the season and specifically with regards to monsters. In Stranger Things, it was the demogorgon from the Dungeons and Dragons game during which we were introduced to the gang. The demogorgon was a monstrous, humanoid entity who could traverse between two worlds, similar to the duality of the D&amp;D monster and its two heads. In Stranger Things 2, we open on the gang arriving to a video arcade. Although Dragons Lair could foreshadow the towering size and scope of the danger they would face in the Mind Flayer, Dig Dug provided a more concise picture of how they would be able to access the monster while in Hawkins. Stranger Things 3 shows the kids sneaking into a film instead of playing a game. Still, the film is George A. Romeros Day of the Dead. Day of the Deads setting is an underground missile base that is reflected in the secret Russian compound which much of the action takes place in. Its also a film about people and what happens when the people we know lose their humanity because theyve been possessed by an evil externality. In Day of the Dead, its a zombie-breeding contagion. In ST3, its the influence of the Mind Flayer. **My Prediction** :With ST3 ending at the end of summer 1985 and seemingly setting up a Thanksgiving reunion for the gang. There is only one piece of media that will be on the teens minds:Super Mario Bros. Released in September of 1985, Super Mario Bros. is a phenomenon and cultural-marker that persists to this day as a reference. I have a feeling that ST4 will open up with the kids all obsessed with the harrowing plight of an Italian plumber as he ventures through pipes and beyond to reach his process and save her from the evil Bowser. Now, **what this means for the story** ;[HUGE SPOILERS]Hopper isnt dead and is trapped in the cell in Kamatchka - a remote Siberian outpost.  Other Reddit and Twitter users have pointed out some very good reasons to have hope. Namely:+ Unlike other beloveds weve lost, Hopper isnt shown dead or dying. + The camera showing us the slow progress of the gate closing and Hoppers glance at it. + Not the American... right after Hoppers death would be a horribly stupid way to foreshadow Modines return as Brenner. If Brenner is going to turn into a Palpatine-level big bad for the series, it would have been more sinister to reveal him in full or in part as unmistakably Brenner. + The music cue (Gabriels cover of Heroes) was the same as the one used when Will was found dead. in Stranger Things.+ Oh look! Its a demogorgon in Russia - wonder where they got that (beside perhaps the gate that Alexei had said they were trying to open over there, but was seemingly blocked by the open one in Hawkins).+ The lack of a happy ending for several characters whose happiness seems deeply tied to Hoppers survival. Looking at these facts, I predict that ST4 will be a rescue operation that sees the gang using Els regained powers to track Hopper to Russia and rescue him the only way a group of 15-21-year-olds could: By going through the Upside Down the way Mario must travel downward through pipes to rescue his princess. Since we saw nothing of the Upside Down this season, I think ST4 will use the shows understandably-astronomic budget to set the majority of the season there. I also expect a sideplot with Brenner (who I believe is still alive - just not in a cage in Russia) and perhaps the return of Kali. The Duffer Brothers have given us so much serendipity throughout this show. In the way, Id love to be wrong and have something even grander or better happen, as long as will gets to just fucking chill for a season and we see more spy work from Dustin, Robin and Steve."
